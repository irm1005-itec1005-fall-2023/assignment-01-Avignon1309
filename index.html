      <section>
        <h2 id="Overall">Overall Situation Around the World </h2>

        <p>The unemployment rate is a lagging indicator, 
          meaning it responds (rises and falls) to changing economic conditions rather than influencing or predicting them. 
          When the economy grows at a healthy rate, 
          the job market is plentiful and the unemployment rate drops. 
          When the economy is experiencing a recession or other turbulence, 
          the job market tends to retract and the unemployment rate rises in response.</p>

        <p>When evaluating the unemployment rates of countries in comparison with one another, 
          it is vital to keep in mind that it is not always an apples-to-apples comparison. 
          For starters, not every country has the same definition of unemploymentâ€”for instance, 
          some countries say that if a person is able to work but not currently employed, 
          that person is unemployed. But other countries only consider a person unemployed 
          if they are actively seeking work. People who are not working 
          and not looking for work are not considered unemployed. Obviously, 
          these different definitions will have an impact on the unemployment rates posted by those countries.</p>

        <h2 id="Impact">Impacts and Challenges</h2>

        <p>Unemployment has many adverse effects, 
          including: increased depression and other mental health problems, 
          increased crime rates, overall lower economic productivity and consumption, 
          lower rates of volunteerism, and erosion of skills. Surprisingly, 
          exceptionally low unemployment can also create economic challenges, 
          such as excessive inflation (when everyone is employed and has money to spend, 
          demand for products can outstrip supply, which causes a rise in prices).</p>

        <p>However, A low unemployment rate does not necessarily indicate that 
            a country's people are living in favorable, sustainable conditions. 
            A report released by the International Labor Organization found that 
            many of the 3.3 billion people throughout the world who are technically employed 
            are working under substandard conditions that offer too little pay, poor economic security, 
            and little to no opportunity for advancement.</p>
